# SMTP to Telegram

Do you have an ancient system or piece of software that only supports sending notifications via SMTP, but you want to get notifications via telegram? Well today's your lucky day!



### Configuration

`Hostname` : Host name of the machine the app is hosted on. If its being accessed locally, just put in localhost.

`Port` : Port number used by the application. By default its 2025

`Bot Token` : The token for the bot. You can get it from the [Bot Father](https://t.me/BotFather).

`Bot Target` : The target chat for the bot to forward the email to.

> Note: If you're sending the messages to a channel, make sure that the bot has permissions to do so and if you're sending messages to a user or yourself, you have to enter in your chat ID, which you can get via the [Chat ID Bot](https://t.me/myidbot)
